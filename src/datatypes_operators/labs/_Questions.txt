Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?
    boolean
    char
    byte
    short
    long
    int
    float
    double

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
    int x = 42

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
    It would lose the decimal value since int's can only be whole numbers.

*** 4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
    int x = 2
    double x = 2.0

    *** correct form since an int will fit into a double; doesn't require a casting?

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
    + addition
    - subtraction
    / division
    * multiplication
    % modulus (finds the remainder of a division equation)

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
    They're used as greater than, less than, not equal too, used to compare number values.
    The result evaluates to a boolean value.

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
    int x = 4;
    if (x => 3);
        System.out.println( "x is " + x +);

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
    Logical operators evaluate two booleans. Results are either and, or or not.

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
    int y = 2, 4;
    if (y = 2 & 4);
        System.out.println( "Y is 2 and 4.")

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
    x += 10;

11.) What data type is a String?
    an Object type.

12.) Are string mutable?
    No, they cannot be changed once created.

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?
    using +
    String firstName = Ashley;
    String lastName = Grush;

14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?
    You can if you use a conversion; a string is typically just characters.

15.) What is an array?


16.) What is the first index of an array?

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
