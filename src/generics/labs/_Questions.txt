Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
    Generics make your program flexible.

2.) What is type erasure?
    The Generic type parameters are replaced at compile time by Java;
    an "E" for example will be replaced by "String" everywhere "E" is present.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
    Car, Vehicle and Engine.

4.) Can an interface be generic?
    Yes, but it can get a bit messy.

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
    Bound generic types restrict the types that can be used as type arguments in a parameterized type;
    ie, Numbers will only take numbers. Unbounded is more of a place holder, leaving it open to be
    declared at initialization.
