1.) What is the if statement used for?
    it's used to determine if a program should execute a sequence of code.

2.) What is good real life application of a switch statement?
    telling time on a clock; ex. "It's 4 o'clock".

3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
    A while loop starts from the top and a do-while loop starts at the bottom, always running at lest once.

4.) What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?

    you leave all portions of the for loop out:
    for(; ;) {

6.) What is the difference between the break statement and the continue statement?
    The break statement forces the code to exit the loop;
    continue forces the code to skip to the next statement.

7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?
    No, but it can become very messy, buggy and confusing.

*** 8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
    No, similar to above answer; but depends on memory to load the program.

    *** Correct answer??
