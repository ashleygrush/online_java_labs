Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
    It's when a subclass inherits all the fields and methods from a superclass.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
    the concept is easy to use and yet the results are incredibly powerful and stable.
    When a class is able to be inherited, code can be reused in many places without having to worry about functional issues.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
    A "how to" application for starting a computer v. starting a tablet or cell phone.
    the first method would have the start up sequence and would cascade to the new sub classes.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
    a subclass adds (extend) a superclass when itâ€™s declared.

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
    There's no limit, but it can get messy after 10 or so.

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
    If the parent class has a custom constructor, you must manually invoked the parent constructor inside the child constructor.
    Super is used to call the parent class's custom constructor.

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
    From the super

8.) What is method overwriting?
    method overwriting overrides a method in a parent class.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
    It can keep the original method intact, while making a new method for a subclass that may need a different method.
